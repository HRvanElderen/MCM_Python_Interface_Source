If we want to compare with community detection on graph, we would have:  

1.  to infer a network from the binary data, for instance using a pairwise Ising model;
2.  use community detection on that graph.

One way to test how good is the algorithm is to test the robustness of the outcome with bootstrapping (might be too difficult).
